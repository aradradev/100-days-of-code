# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 06, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Start working on a School Library Testing part in Ruby using RSpec.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the unit test, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Ruby is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
